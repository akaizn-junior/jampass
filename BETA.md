# Jampass

Help me improve Jampass.

Jampass is a static site generator that aims to bridge the gap between content making and content publishing.

The system helps funnel data to your templates to generate HTML super fast, while providing a modern development environment.

This Beta program is for anyone interested in writing vanilla web projects that are built using a static site generator, Jampass.

Participants may write code as they wish following the documentation, and report any bugs they find along the way.

I would also appreciate any tips on typos and such on the docs.

Your help and contribution will be much appreciated and showcased on the incoming Jampass Gallery of Projects.

Thank you in advance and thank you for your contribution.
