const Jampass = require('jampass');

// Use any headless CMS, we use contentful here just as an example
const contentful = require('contentful');

Jampass.funnel(async () => {
  const client = contentful.createClient({ ... })
  const entries = await client.getEntries({ ... })

  const result = entries.map(entry => {
    ...
  })

  return result;
})

// Jampass will use default configurations, then, voil√°!
